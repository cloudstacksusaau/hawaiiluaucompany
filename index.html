	<h1>Hawaii Luau Company, LLC</h1>
	<p>
	Hawaii Luau Company is comprised of Hawaiian cultural experts Kaniala and Melody Masoe, along with veteran show producers and director, Jeff Gitlin and Larry Pellegrini. We are a fully encompassed luau, accounting, sales, marketing and production company, with over 20+ years of creating the highest quality Hawaiian Entertainment. 

	Hawaii Luau Company is the production company which created “Huaka’i – Journey Through Polynesia,” which had a 6-year weekly performance run at the Ka’anapali Beach Club Resort in Maui, Hawaii. As veteran producers of luaus in Hawaii, we are happy to present our vision for a highly entertaining, yet true depiction of a Hawaiian Luau for Seascape Restaurant at Maalaea Harbor at the Maui Ocean Center. We recognize the importance of highlighting the ocean conservation objective… to showcase a luau reflective of its Hawaiian spirit regarding the preservation of the Hawaiian Oceans.  We are happy to tell the story of the Hawaiian Islands and the Journey Through Polynesia.
